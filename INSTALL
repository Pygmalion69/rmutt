INSTALLING RMUTT

REQUIREMENTS

Compiling rmutt requires flex and bison (1.5 or greater) as well as
POSIX regex support. These are standard in virtually all Linux
distributions, but may need to be downloaded from a GNU archive for
other UNIX systems. GNU packages can be downloaded from

ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/

or one of its mirrors. Cygwin has its own way of downloading packages;
for details go to

http://www.cygwin.com/

Since 2.6, rmutt also requires the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic
Library, also known as libgmp, which rmutt uses to index all possible
strings of any grammar.

http://gmplib.org/

and binary packages are available for most popular *nix distributions.

COMPILING RMUTT

Under UNIX or Cygwin, just unpack the archive, and enter the resulting
directory:

	gunzip -c rmutt.tar.gz | tar x
	cd rmutt

Now edit the Makefile; inside the Makefile are instructions for how to
modify it. Note especially that you may want to modify PREFIX, which
by default is /usr/local. Once you've edited the Makefile, run the
following command:

	make

If there are no problems, the directory should now contain an rmutt
executable. To test rmutt, run the following command:

	make test

If this succeeds, you can install rmutt and its supporting files using
"make install". Note that you must have appropriate permissions to
the PREFIX directory.

USING RMUTT

Using rmutt under UNIX or Cygwin is simple; just make sure the
executable is in your path, or type ./rmutt if you're in the same
directory as the executable.

COMMAND-LINE SYNTAX

rmutt accepts a grammar as an input. If you have a file with an rmutt
grammar in it, you can mention it on the command line like this:

	rmutt myfile.rm

If you want to save the output to a file you can simply redirect it:

	rmutt myfile.rm > myoutputfile

If you have a program which generates an rmutt grammar, you can pipe
it through rmutt like this:

	myprogram | rmutt

Note: rmutt does not require that the names of grammar files end with
".rm" or any other specific extension.
