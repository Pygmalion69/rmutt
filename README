Hello, welcome to rmutt!

INTRODUCTION

"rmutt" is a utility for generating random text from context-free
grammars (a.k.a. recursive transition networks). It's modeled after
Andrew C. Bulhak's late, great "dada engine" which he used to write
the hilarious Postmodern Thesis Generator.

  default package.
* Fixed memory leak in parser.

  have infinite or just very deep grammars
