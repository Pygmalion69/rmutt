Hello, welcome to rmutt!

INTRODUCTION

"rmutt" is a utility for generating random text from context-free
grammars (a.k.a. recursive transition networks). It's modeled after
Andrew C. Bulhak's late, great "dada engine" which he used to write
the hilarious Postmodern Thesis Generator.

VERSION

2.2.1

CHANGE HISTORY

2.2.1

* fixed memory management bug in support for lexical scope

2.2

* added scope qualifiers for nested assignments and rules

2.1

* added -d flag for backward compatibility with 1.x dynamic rule scope

2.0

* embedded rules and assignments now have lexical scope, rather than dynamic scope.

1.6

* #includes added

1.5

* complex mappings added. a literal can now be mapped to an expression,
  not just another literal.

1.4

* -i feature for enumerating all possible strings

1.3

* Added the following iteration shorthands:
  - ? => {0,1}
  - * => {0,5}
  - + => {1,5}
* Fixed bug where iteration code was using rand() instead of random()

1.2.2

* Added random seed option.
* Added line numbers in error reporting.

1.2.1

1.2

* Changed stack size limit behavior from exiting to halting
  expansion at the current depth.
* Added "&" choice qualifier to multiply the probability that
  a choice will be selected.
* Changed from rand() to random() for better random number
  generation.
* Added test script and test target to Makefile

1.1

* Made it so that when rmutt can't find a rule in the current
  package, it searches for a rule with the same name in the
  default package.
* Fixed memory leak in parser.
* Added a stack size limit to prevent crashes when grammars
  have infinite or just very deep grammars

1.0

* Initial revision
